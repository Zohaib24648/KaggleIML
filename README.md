# Machine Learning Competition IBA Karachi

This repository contains my work on various machine learning and data science techniques. Below is a description of the models and algorithms implemented as part of my training and development process.

## Overview

This project is focused on implementing and understanding both basic and advanced machine learning algorithms. It includes supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, and utilizes a variety of tools and libraries to address different types of data science challenges.

## Models and Algorithms Used

In this project, I have worked with the following models and algorithms:

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting a continuous variable.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Used for classification and regression tasks.
- **Regression Trees**: Trees that predict continuous values.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: Used for classification and regression.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Ensemble Methods**:
  - **Bagging**: Helps reduce variance and avoid overfitting.
  - **Boosting**: Combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner.
  - **AdaBoost**: An adaptive boosting technique that adjusts the weights of incorrectly classified instances.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used for dimensionality reduction.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: A type of hierarchical clustering.
- **Partitional Clustering**: Clustering data into distinct groups.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise.

### Neural Networks
- Basic architectures for both regression and classification tasks.

### Advanced Gradient Boosting Models
- **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning.
- **CatBoost**: An algorithm that handles categorical data automatically.
- **XGBoost**: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library.

## Tools and Libraries

This project utilizes Python and several associated libraries and frameworks, including:
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch (for Neural Network implementations)
- XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for gradient boosting.
